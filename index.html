            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <hr>
            By learning about your menstrual cycle and signs of fertility you can use this information to
            help you conceive, avoid pregnancy or learn more about your fertility and menstrual cycle. No fancy
            devices are needed, just a pen, digital thermometer, a fertility chart and individualised teaching from
            a Fertility First Fertility Educator.

            <p>Fertility First offers education in fertility, the menstrual cycle and natural family planning
                methods to women and their partners, health professionals and community groups.

            <p>We teach only the scientifically proven Sympto-Thermal Method and the Lactational Amenorrhoea
                Methods of Natural Family Planning as approved by the World Health Organisation.
            <p>
                Our Fertility Educators are accredited with Natural Fertility New Zealand.
